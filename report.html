    <h1>Technical Components</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>We have five pages: Dashboard-which shows important general information to the user, Orders-which shows all the orders together, Orderview-which is the specific order which can be accessed throught the orderview, Transactions-which keeps track of the monetary side of each order for the user, and About-which explains the company and offerings from the company</li>
        <li>We used the <img src="images/favicon.png" alt="favicon company image of ramen bowl with chopsticks"> <a href="https://icons8.com/icon/8379/noodles">favicon found here</a> on every page which is our company logo</li>
        <li>Our sites header holds the favicon image, and navigation for the site</li>
        <li>The navigation links are in the header and are used for navigation from the nav-bar at the top</li>
        <li>The page scales differently for desktop use and mobile use (specifically iphone)</li>
        <li>We use an image on the page of the ramen which has an alt tag, and used images for the edit order button pencil on the orderview page plus for the Drop from the Queue for the Trashcan</li>
        <li>We checked the Nu Validator and WAVE tool and had no errors or warnings after fixing initial ones</li>
        <li>h1's use arial halvetica, and all other text uses roboto</li>
        <li>We have a form field for searching orders on the Order page, and a form field on the Transaction page to search transactions</li>
        <li>We have a link to go to the official govenment page on image fair use on the about page</li>
        <li>The site is available <a href="https://lipsih.github.io/343-s23-p1/">here</a></li>
        <li>This is the report, and the design sketch is <a href="https://lipsih.github.io/343-s23-p1/design/sketch.pdf">here</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Professional Practices and Design Quality</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>We have organized all the files in their respective directories</li>
        <li>We used a framework which had repeated styles in the main.css file, and orders.css since the orders needed specific styling</li>
        <li>Our content is neatly aligned, with most of it favoring the left and taking adequate space of the page</li>
        <li>The text is spaced with a good amount of padding to make sure not text bleeds over</li>
        <li>We used consisten formatting with kebab-case</li>
        <li>Our site is very accessable with frequent use of alt tags accross all images and simply outlined data for screen readers to go over</li>
        <li>all our files are lowercase and have alphanumeric characters</li>
        <li>We added comments above the large sections of html in order to help a reader understand what part of the page they're looking at</li>            
    </ol>
